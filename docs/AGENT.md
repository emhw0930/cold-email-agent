# AGENT.md — How to drive this tool with Claude / Cowork

This file tells you (Claude, running in Cowork) how to operate this project when the user
gives you a company + job description. Read this first, then follow the workflow.

---

## What this project is
A human-in-the-loop cold-outreach tool. The user applies to a job, then pastes the
**company name + job description (JD)** to you. Your job: find the right people, write
tailored emails referencing the user's resume, get approval, send, and log.

- Code lives in `src/`. Secrets/config in `.env` (loaded by `src/config.py`).
- The user's resume is at `assets/resume.pdf` (attached automatically on every send).
- Every send is logged to Google Sheets.
- **Always run Python from the repo root** with the venv active:
  `source venv/bin/activate` then `python src/<module>.py`.

---

## The workflow (when the user pastes a company + JD)

**a. Confirm eligibility & fit.**
   - Check the JD for location/eligibility restrictions (e.g. "not eligible in CA, NY, PA…").
     The user's resume location is **Atlanta, GA** — flag any conflict before proceeding.
   - Note the exact **role title** and **team** (you'll reference these in the email).

**b. Determine the company's email pattern (ONCE) — then GUESS the rest to save Prospeo credits.**
   - **Reveal only ONE verified email** via Prospeo to learn the company's format
     (patterns vary: `first.last@`, `flast@`, `firstname@`, `lastname.first@`, and the
     domain may differ, e.g. `@bloomberg.net`, `@qti.qualcomm.com`).
   - Then get the remaining recruiter **names** from Prospeo *search* (cheap, no reveal) or
     web search, and **construct their emails from the confirmed pattern** — do NOT spend a
     Prospeo enrich credit per person. The free tier is ~75 credits/month, so one reveal +
     pattern-guessing the rest is the default.
   - Caveat: pattern-guessing bounces if the pattern is inconsistent (Uber/Qualcomm use
     several formats) or the person left the company. If a company's format looks
     inconsistent, fall back to revealing verified emails for the few that matter.

**c. Find the right people (US-based).**
   - **Default: whenever a JD comes in, automatically find 10 US-based recruiters online**
     (LinkedIn / web search) for that role — no need to be asked. Prioritize
     technical/university/early-career recruiters. If fewer than 10 are publicly reachable,
     surface as many good-fit names as you can find and say so.
   - Search Prospeo for **US-based recruiters** (technical/university recruiters fit SWE roles)
     and, when asked, **hiring managers** on the JD's specific team.
   - Filter to `person_location_search: {include: ["United States"]}`.
   - **Only use Prospeo-VERIFIED emails** — `UNAVAILABLE` means the person likely left;
     guessed/pattern emails to them bounce. If the user insists on someone unverified,
     warn about bounce risk first.
   - Verify a hiring manager's team on LinkedIn (web search) before recommending them —
     don't email someone on the wrong team.

**d. Draft a tailored email per person.**
   - Use `src/email_generator.py` (Claude) or write it directly. Keep it ~100–120 words.
   - Tie the user's resume specifics to the JD (e.g. messaging-app project ↔ messaging role,
     LangGraph/AI agent work ↔ AI roles, GCP/FastAPI ↔ backend/cloud roles).
   - Lead with **UC Berkeley CS** + **Genuine Parts Company (Fortune 200)**.
   - Signature: name, phone, **both emails** (gmail + berkeley), LinkedIn. **No GitHub.**
   - **Always include the job number / requisition ID in the email if the JD has one**
     (e.g. "Job 210759344", "Role #200669637") — put it in the first sentence next to the
     role title so the recruiter can route you instantly.
   - Do **not** mention H1B unless the user confirms the company sponsors.

**e. Show the draft(s) and WAIT for approval.**
   - Always preview before sending. Let the user edit wording, recipients, count.

**f. Send + log.**
   - On approval, send with resume attached and log each to the Google Sheet.
   - Dedup is by **recipient email** — the same person won't be emailed twice, but multiple
     people for one role is fine.

**g. Report results + watch for bounces.**
   - Summarize who was emailed. Tell the user to watch for bounce-backs (only relevant if
     any unverified addresses were used).

## Defaults & preferences (the user, Ethan Wu)
- New-grad SWE, needs H1B sponsorship, based in Atlanta GA (eligible for most US-remote roles).
- Email tone: concise, professional, specific. No buzzwords, no "I hope this finds you well."
- Prefers **quality over volume** — targeted, verified, tailored. 5–10 contacts per role is plenty.
- Resume highlights to draw from: UC Berkeley CS; GPC (LangGraph AI agent, Google ADK, FastAPI/
  Spring Boot, GCP — Cloud Run/BigQuery/GCS, React/TypeScript); full-stack Socket.IO messaging app.

## Guardrails
- **ALWAYS give the user a look at the email before you send. Show the full draft(s) and wait for an explicit "send" — no exceptions.**
- Never commit or paste secrets. They live only in `.env` (gitignored).
- Never send without showing a preview and getting an explicit "send".
- Prefer verified emails; warn before sending to guessed/pattern addresses.
- Respect Prospeo's free-tier credits (~75/month) — don't reveal more emails than needed.
